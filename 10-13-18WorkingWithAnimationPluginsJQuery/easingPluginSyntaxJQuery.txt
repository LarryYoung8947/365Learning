//Example of JavaScript Syntax for using Easing plugin(plugin for different timing functions for animation)

$('#bc2').animate({

	top: to
	
	},
 2000,

	'easeOutBounce');


does not include wrapper function such as click handler. 'easeOutBounce represents function name in JQuery Plug-in

As per usual, always add plugin as script tag in html file and make sure to research current compatability or any changes made to plug-in by author
